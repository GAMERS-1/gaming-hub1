<h2 style="font-size:50px;">ABOUT:</h2>
<p style="font-size:25px;">Dr. Driving is a game that presents all kinds of driving challenges, ranging from speed to fuel efficiency. Your goal is to beat the driving challenges, increase your driver level and get better and better cars to get rid of that ugly KOS van that you begin the game with.

There are a number of different driving missions that you can do in this game. The VIP Escort is a game where your goal is to drive as normally as possible. Change lanes safely, don’t slide around turns, and park smoothly. Speed Parking requires you to get to the parking spot and park in it as quickly as possible. The speed mission requires you to get to the finish line as soon as possible, and includes turns. The highway speed mode is the same as the speed mission, except with no turns – just avoiding other cars.

The drift mission requires you to fill the drift meter by spending the required amount of time sliding sideways. The fuel efficiency mission requires you to get to the finish line without running out of gas, and to modulate the throttle correctly so that you can conserve as much gas as possible. Some of these missions are harder to complete than other missions, but practice makes perfect. Most of the missions are fairly self explanatory, but drifting can be a tough one. A good way to drift is to nail the gas as you are going into a turn, then correct in the other direction with the wheel once you start your turn so that you can stay in your lane. If you don’t stay in your lane, you’ll either hit other cars or hit one of the side guardrails, and if you hit one or the other, you immediately lose the game. If you pass a mission, you will earn both coins and experience points, with the experience points contributing to your driver level. As you earn coins, as well, you can buy upgrades and even new cars, which will add to your speed and handling, increase your fuel efficiency, and help you to finish almost all of your missions.
