<h2 style="font-size:50px;">HISTORY:</h2>
<p style="font-size:25px;">The game of carrom originated in India.[2] One carrom board with its surface made of glass is still available in one of the palaces in Patiala, India.[3] State-level competitions were being held in the different states of India during the early part of the 20th century. Serious carrom tournaments may have begun in Sri Lanka in 1935; by 1958, both India and Sri Lanka had formed official federations of carrom clubs, sponsoring tournaments and awarding prizes.[4]

The International Carrom Federation[5][6] (ICF) was formed in the year 1988 in Chennai, India. The formal rules for the Indian version of the game were published in 1988. In the same year the ICF officially codified the rules. The UKCF was formed in 1991 in London. The main work of this organisation is to promote the game of Carrom throughout the UK and ensure the participation of UK players in all major international championships.The UKCF have hosted 3 Euro cups in England and have had fantastic success in the tournament with UK players. UKCF organised national championships and league tournaments throughout the UK on annual basis.[7]

The United States Carrom Association reports on competitions in the US and Canada and has a player ranking list as of the last tournament.[8]

A group of Carrom enthusiasts grouped together in 2004 and established the Pakistani Carrom Federation or PCF. The PCF have worked to build clubs across Pakistan to promote and teach the game.

The German Carrom Federation was founded in 1986 with the objective of supporting and maintaining the game of Carrom. The federation oversees Germany Carrom Clubs and teams throughout Germany.

The Italian Carrom Federation was founded in 1995 by a group of Carrom enthusiasts and is responsible for the spread of the game throughout Italy. The federation is supported by a large number of volunteers who regularly run events throughout Italy to teach and educate about the game.

The Japan Carrom Federation was established in 1997. In 2001 they moved into their new headquarters in Tokyo from Hikone. Originally set up to allow players to compete in overseas tournament but held their first national championship in 2004 and now hold tournaments, demonstrations and training camps across Japan.

The board and pieces can be bought in UK, Europe, North America or Australia and are usually imported from India. The most expensive boards are made to a high standard with high quality wood and decorations though cheaper boards are available. Some of the largest exporters of carrom boards are in India, e.g. Precise, Surco, Syndicate Sports and Paul Traders.</p>


<h3 style="font-size:50px;">RULES:</h3>
<p style="font-size:25px;">Point carrom is a variant that is popular with children or an odd number of players. Each player is allowed to pocket carrom men of any colour.

Carrom men of either colour are assigned 1 point each.
The queen gives 5 points.
The black gives 1 points.
The white gives 2 points.
To get queen points, one needs to put a carrom man of any colour in the same pocket after the queen on the same or a subsequent strike in the same turn. If the player fails to "cover" the queen in this fashion, the queen is put back in the center of the board.
The first player to reach 25 points is declared the winner.
If no player reaches 25 points, the player with the highest points is declared the winner. If the scores are tied, a tie-breaker must be played. Players who are tied select a colour and are only allowed to pocket carrom men of the other colour on the rebound.

Family-point carrom (also known as simple-point carrom) is an informal variant suitable for an odd number of players. Each player is allowed to pocket carrom men of any colour.

Typically, a black carrom man scores 10 points, and a white scores 20 points
The queen scores 50 points.
As in point carrom, the queen must be "covered" pocketing another carrom man in the same pocket on the same or subsequent strike in one's turn.
With the points system, if one team/player gets queen points early in the game, the opponent still has a good chance to win by earning more points.
This style of play is widely accepted in many areas of South-East Asia.
Total-point

The black carrom men are worth 1, 5, or 10 point(s) and the white ones are worth 2, 10, or 20 points (depending on exact game variant).
The queen is assigned 5 or 50 points. As in the above two variants, it must have a carrom man pocketed after it.
To win, a player must receive all the carrom men on the board.[clarification needed]
After the first round, the player or team with the lowest score puts all their carrom men in the center.
The others must match this score in the center and the players play for the carrom men in the center.
They repeat this until one team or player has all the carrom men.
This style of play is widely accepted in many areas of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.</p>
